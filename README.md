## About the Course  
This intermediate-level course focuses on practical implementation of deep learning models using Keras and TensorFlow. 
Key topics include:  
- TensorFlow architecture and execution model  
- Building and training neural networks  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers for sequence data
- Model optimization techniques  
- Transfer learning approaches

## How to Use  
1. Clone and access the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phaa/ibm-advanced-keras-tensorflow.git
   cd ibm-advanced-keras-tensorflow/
   ```
2. Setup virtual environment (conda ou venv):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n env python=3.8
   conda activate env
   ```
3. Start Jupyter lab:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
*In each notebook there is a cell dedicated to dependencies instalation*
